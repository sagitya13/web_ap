            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Born in 1906 in a family of Tamil Brahmins, R.K. Narayan was the second eldest son in a family of eight children. He was born in the Madras Presidency of British India but still made a reputed name for himself even amongst the conventional English readers.
                Narayan was an avid reader from his childhood days and loved to read the writings of some of the best authors of that time. Some of his favorite authors were Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Wodehouse. Narayan developed a deep interest in writing after reading all these phenomenal authors and thus started to look for opportunities to showcase his abilities to the world.</p>
                <p> R.K. Narayan took four years to complete his graduation, which was a year longer than the normal duration of the course. And, then he started teaching in a school but soon decided to quit this job to pursue a full-time career in writing. Narayan was once visiting Coimbatore, and there R.K. fell in love with a girl named Rajam. After facing several obstacles, he finally married Rajam in 1934.

                1930. After completing his graduation, Narayan took a job as a school teacher in a local school.
                Soon after, he realized that the only career for him was in writing, and he decided to stay at home
                and write novels. He was supported in every way by his family. In 1933 Narayan married Rajam
                whom he loved, against the Indian custom of arranged marriage. They had only child, a daughter
                named Hema in 1938. Narayan’s domestic happiness was short lived. Unfortunately, his wife,
                Rajam died of typhoid in 1939. He never remarried. He created a number of female characters in
                his writings based on Rajm.</p>
